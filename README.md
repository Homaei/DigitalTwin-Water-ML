# Water Consumption Forecasting Using Digital Twins and AI/ML

## Overview

This project focuses on forecasting water consumption using machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) models, leveraging data from **Digital Twins** implemented for various villages in Spain. Digital Twins provide daily real-time and historical data for water consumption, allowing for accurate predictions and enhanced resource management.

We implemented a digital twin system that collects data from various sources, such as water meters, meteorology stations, and programmable logic controllers (PLCs). The data is then processed using AI/ML models to predict water consumption and detect leakages.
