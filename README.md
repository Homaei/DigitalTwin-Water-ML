# Water Consumption Forecasting Using Digital Twins and AI/ML

## Overview

This project leverages **Digital Twin** technology along with advanced **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** models to accurately forecast water consumption across multiple rural villages in Spain. By integrating real-time and historical data collected by Digital Twins, we aim to support effective resource management, optimize infrastructure planning, and enhance sustainability.

### Digital Twin System

Our **Digital Twin** setup collects data from multiple sources:

- **Water Meters**: Capture regular water usage data.
- **Meteorological Stations**: Provide weather data, helping identify correlations with water consumption.
- **Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs)**: Monitor and control the water distribution system for improved operational efficiency.

This data is aggregated and processed through ML and AI models to forecast water consumption and detect anomalies. By identifying unusual patterns early, we enable timely responses to leaks, reducing waste and supporting efficient water usage.

### Importance of Water Consumption Forecasting

Accurate water forecasting is crucial for managing finite water resources, supporting infrastructure planning, and enhancing sustainability. The benefits of a robust forecasting model include:

1. **Improved Resource Management**: Predictions allow for optimized supply, minimizing waste and cost.
2. **Better Infrastructure Decisions**: Insights from forecasts support maintenance and expansion prioritization.
3. **Enhanced Sustainability**: By aligning distribution with demand, we conserve energy and reduce environmental impacts.

### Forecasting Models and Methodologies

The project evaluates several models for water consumption forecasting over 6-month and 18-month horizons, comparing traditional and advanced ML methods:

1. **Prophet Model**: A time series forecasting model designed for seasonality, holidays, and custom regressors, tailored for periodic consumption changes.
2. **XGBoost and LightGBM**: Efficient and accurate boosted tree algorithms, further improved with custom feature engineering.
3. **LSTM Neural Networks**: Long Short-Term Memory networks, ideal for capturing long-sequence dependencies essential in forecasting water trends.

### Feature Engineering

Advanced feature engineering techniques were applied to enhance predictive accuracy:

- **Lag Features**: Integrate past consumption data to capture temporal patterns.
- **Rolling Statistics**: Use rolling means, standard deviations, and max values to smooth out short-term fluctuations.
- **Domain-Specific Variables**: Incorporate factors like maximum daily temperature and day of the week, significantly impacting water usage.

### Hyperparameter Tuning

We fine-tuned each model to optimize performance:

- **Prophet Model**: Tuned seasonality, added holiday effects, and custom regressors.
- **LSTM Model**: Adjusted dropout rates, learning rates, sequence length, and layer units through grid and randomized search.
- **Stacking Ensemble Methods**: Combined outputs from XGBoost and LightGBM models to increase robustness by capturing different aspects of the data.

### Model Evaluation Metrics

Each model was evaluated on the following metrics to identify top performers across 6-month and 18-month forecasting periods:

1. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average error magnitude in predictions.
2. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Provides a higher penalty for large prediction errors.
3. **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**: Standardized error measurement as a percentage for cross-model comparison.

Based on these metrics, the best models for each forecasting period are presented in the following sections.

  - **Meteorological Data**: Collected from meteorological stations to improve prediction accuracy. We evaluated the relationship between different parameters and water consumption using the Pearson correlation method. Our analysis revealed that maximum temperature positively correlates with water consumption. The results of this correlation analysis are presented in the following figure.

- **Main Features**:
  - **Water Consumption Prediction**: AI and ML models, including **LSTM** and **Prophet**, are used for forecasting daily water usage.
  - **Leakage Detection**: Early detection of water leakages by analyzing consumption patterns.
  - **Energy Consumption and CO2 Footprint**: Monitoring the energy impact of water distribution and associated CO2 emissions (These parameters result from maintaining the water distribution network). For example, each operator has several tasks with a variety of time, location, priority, and other metrics, and the scheduling with preemption (Urgent tasks) is an NP-hard problem.
