# Water Consumption Forecasting Using Digital Twins and AI/ML

## Overview
This project focuses on leveraging machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) models for water consumption forecasting, using data collected through **Digital Twins** implemented across various villages in Spain. By providing real-time and historical data, these Digital Twins enable more accurate predictions and optimized resource management. 

Our digital twin system aggregates data from water meters, meteorological stations, and programmable logic controllers (PLCs). It analyzes this data using AI/ML models to forecast water consumption and detect possible leaks, thereby improving overall efficiency in water resource management.

Accurate water consumption forecasting is vital for effective resource management, infrastructure planning, and sustainability. This report compares various time series forecasting models for predicting water consumption over 6-month and 18-month horizons. The models include traditional statistical methods, like the Prophet model with custom seasonalities and regressors, and more advanced machine learning approaches like XGBoost, LightGBM, and LSTM neural networks.

We applied advanced feature engineering to improve predictive performance, incorporating lag features, rolling statistics, and domain-specific variables such as maximum temperature and day of the week. Both Prophet and LSTM models were optimized through hyperparameter tuning, including techniques like dropout layers, learning rate adjustments, and stacking ensemble methods.

The five top-performing models for the 6-month and 18-month forecasts were evaluated using key performance metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The following sections present the detailed results.

  - **Meteorological Data**: Collected from meteorological stations to improve prediction accuracy. We evaluated the relationship between different parameters and water consumption using the Pearson correlation method. Our analysis revealed that maximum temperature positively correlates with water consumption. The results of this correlation analysis are presented in the following figure.

- **Main Features**:
  - **Water Consumption Prediction**: AI and ML models, including **LSTM** and **Prophet**, are used for forecasting daily water usage.
  - **Leakage Detection**: Early detection of water leakages by analyzing consumption patterns.
  - **Energy Consumption and CO2 Footprint**: Monitoring the energy impact of water distribution and associated CO2 emissions (These parameters result from maintaining the water distribution network). For example, each operator has several tasks with a variety of time, location, priority, and other metrics, and the scheduling with preemption (Urgent tasks) is an NP-hard problem.
